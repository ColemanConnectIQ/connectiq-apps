------------------

## Purpose
This repo is officially maintained by the Garmin&reg; Connect IQ team. We are happy to have you here. It is our hope that this repository will extend the  resources available to our developers to help them build exciting new content!

----------------------

## What's in the Repo?

This repo contains several resources for developers to help in the development process including examples and Garmin Monkey Barrel Code libraries:

**Barrels**
:   Monkey Barrels are the Connect IQ answer to libraries. They are a way for developers to create custom Monkey C libraries containing source code and resource information that can be easily shared across Connect IQ Projects.

<div class="note">
To find out more about Monkey Barrels in Connect IQ please see the <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/monkey-barrels">Monkey Barrels</a> documentation in the Programmer's Guide.
</div>

**Apps**
:    More capable than the other app types, device apps can implement third party activities and provide additional functionality that is not otherwise addressed by the other available app types.

**Datafields**
:   Apps that run within the native activities that allow developers to compute values based off of the current activity, such as running, biking, etc.

**Watchfaces**
:   Low power apps that replace the main watch face and are the home screen on wearable devices. That's right&hellip;no gestures necessary!

**Widgets**
:   At-a-glance apps that are readily accessible from the watch face or device home screen. Widgets automatically close after a period of inactivity
